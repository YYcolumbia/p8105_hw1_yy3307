# Problem 1

The first step is to load the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Here is a brief description of the penguins dataset:

This code chunk is used to conduct summaries(mean) of penguins dataset:

``` r
bill_length_mean = mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
bill_depth_mean = mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mass_mean = mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The “penguins” dataset contains various information about 344 penguins,
which includes variables of **species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year**. In this
dataset, total number of participants are 344 penguins. **“Species”**
indicate the species of each penguin. The penguins can be classiffied as
*3* species: *Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo*. **“Island”** indicate the
place of origin of each penguin. The **“Island”** variable also has
three origins: *Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream*. **“bill_length_mm”**
records the length of each penguin’s bill, the average bill length of
sampled penguins is 43.92 mm. **“bill_depth_mm”** holds the depth of
each penguin’s bill, the mean bill depth of sampled penguins is 17.15
mm. **“body_mass_g”** indicates the weight of each penguin, the average
weight of sampled penguins is 4201.75 g. Lastly, **“sex”** and
**“year”** shows the gender and record time of each penguin.

### Here is the size of the dataset:

The size of the dataset is 344 \* 8, with 344 rows and 8 columns (nrow =
344, ncol = 8).

### Here is the mean flipper length:

Calculate average of flipper_length_mm column (NA skipped):

``` r
flipper_mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean flipper length = 200.92 mm.

### Create a scatter plot with “flipper_length_mm” as y-axis and bill_length_mm as x-axis. Differentiate colors according to species. And use ggsave to export the scatter plot.

``` r
plot_penguins = tibble(
  x = penguins$bill_length_mm,
  y = penguins$flipper_length_mm,
)

Species = penguins$species
ggplot(plot_penguins, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Species)) + geom_point()
```
