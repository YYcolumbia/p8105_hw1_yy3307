### Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

``` r
bill_length_mean = mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
bill_depth_mean = mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mass_mean = mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The “penguins” dataset contains various information about 344 penguins,
which includes variables of **species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year**. In this
dataset, total number of participants are 344 penguins. **“Species”**
indicate the species of each penguin. The penguins can be classiffied as
*3* species: *Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo*. **“Island”** indicate the
place of origin of each penguin. The **“Island”** variable also has
three origins: *Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream*. **“bill_length_mm”**
records the length of each penguin’s bill, the average bill length of
sampled penguins is 43.92mm. **“bill_depth_mm”** holds the depth of each
penguin’s bill, the mean bill depth of sampled penguins is 17.15mm.
**“body_mass_g”** indicates the weight of each penguin, the average
weight of sampled penguins is 4201.75g. Lastly, **“sex”** and **“year”**
shows the gender and record time of each penguin.

The size of the dataset is 344 \* 8, with 344 rows and 8 columns (nrow =
344, ncol = 8).

``` r
flipper_mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean flipper length = 200.92.

``` r
plot_penguins = tibble(
  x = penguins$bill_length_mm,
  y = penguins$flipper_length_mm,
)

Species = penguins$species
ggplot(plot_penguins, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Species)) + geom_point()
```
