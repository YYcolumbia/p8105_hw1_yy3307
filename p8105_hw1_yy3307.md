# Problem 1

The first step is to load the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Brief description of the penguins dataset:

This code chunk is used to conduct summaries(mean) of penguins dataset:

``` r
bill_length_mean = mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
bill_depth_mean = mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mass_mean = mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The “penguins” dataset contains various information about 344 penguins,
which includes variables of **species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year**. In this
dataset, total number of participants are 344 penguins. **“Species”**
indicate the species of each penguin. The penguins can be classiffied as
*3* species: *Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo*. **“Island”** indicate the
place of origin of each penguin. The **“Island”** variable also has
three origins: *Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream*. **“bill_length_mm”**
records the length of each penguin’s bill, the average bill length of
sampled penguins is 43.92 mm. **“bill_depth_mm”** holds the depth of
each penguin’s bill, the mean bill depth of sampled penguins is 17.15
mm. **“body_mass_g”** indicates the weight of each penguin, the average
weight of sampled penguins is 4201.75 g. Lastly, **“sex”** and
**“year”** shows the gender and record time of each penguin.

### Size of the dataset:

The size of the dataset is 344 \* 8, with 344 rows and 8 columns (nrow =
344, ncol = 8).

### Mean flipper length:

Calculate average of flipper_length_mm column (NA skipped):

``` r
flipper_mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean flipper length = 200.92 mm.

### Create a scatter plot with condition and export it.

``` r
plot_penguins = tibble(
  x = penguins$bill_length_mm,
  y = penguins$flipper_length_mm,
)

Species = penguins$species
ggplot(plot_penguins, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Species)) + geom_point()
```

``` r

```

# Problem 2

### Create date frame.

Code chunk below is the dataframe setting:

``` r
q2_df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_logic = random_sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("High", "Medium", "Low", "High", "Medium", "Low","High", "Medium", "Low","High"))
)
```

Then, we will test if each variables in the dataframe has a mean value.

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.4305861

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, vec_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

From the output we can analyse that we are able to calculate the mean
value for numeric variables “random_sample” and “vec_logic”. However, we
cannot find the mean value for “vec_char” and “vec_factor” since they
are not in numerical expression. So when I tried to find mean value for
these two variables, I will receive *NA* as result.

Next, I’m going to apply as.numeric function to logic, char, and factor
variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, vec_logic))
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, vec_factor))
```

The output indicates that we can convert logic variables and factor
variables into numerical expression, but we can’t convert character
vector as numeric. Logic variables will be transferred into 0 and 1
after convertion, and factor variables will be transferred into numbers
starting from 1 according to their factor “levels” in alphabetical
order. This result also shows that the output will fill up with *NA*
variables as place holders if the function cannot apply to the
situation. That’s the reason why I received NA as the output of two mean
values of non numeric vactors.
